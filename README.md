# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The client wants to see how paid versus unpaid reviews effect the overall rating of a product. In order to determine if there is bias we will be extracting, transforming, and loading a Amazon Product review dataset to see if there is a bias towards products if the reviewer was paid or not. This will be broken down by extracting the data and transforming part of it in PySpark then further filtering of the data with SQL. We will see how many paid and unpaid reviews there are and the percentage of five-star reviews each group leaves to see if there is a descrepancy leading to a bias review or not. 

## Results 


Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
