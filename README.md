# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The client wants to see how paid versus unpaid reviews effect the overall rating of a product. In order to determine if there is bias we will be extracting, transforming, and loading a Amazon Product review dataset to see if there is a bias towards products if the reviewer was paid or not. This will be broken down by extracting the data and transforming part of it in PySpark then further filtering of the data with SQL. We will see how many paid and unpaid reviews there are and the percentage of five-star reviews each group leaves to see if there is a descrepancy leading to a bias review or not. 

## Results 

In Google Collab we download the dataset and used PySpark to filter the data set from null values and duplicates. Then we proceeded to upload the CSV file of the vine_table to PosGreSQL to finish filtering and transforming the data.

Once the CSV file was uploaded into our PostGreSQL we opened a query to find only reviews that had a number of 20 or more total_votes so we can deal with more viewed reviews instead of all of them. After filtering it we then created another table to find reviews that were most helpful by filtering out results were the helpful_votes divided by the total_votes was equal to or greater than 50%. This gives us table that has reviews that are deemed most helpful by other users. See the two tables below for the resulting filtered table and good reviews table generated by the queries.

From the good_review table we will further break it down to paid and unpaid reviews by querying if the vine columns of the tables equals 'Y' for paid by vine or 'N' for unpaid reviews.

The resulting tables for the paid vine reviews reults in **22 total paid reviews** while the number of **unpaid reviews is 26,987**. See the following tables below for the paid and unpaid reviews.

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

## Summary 

In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
